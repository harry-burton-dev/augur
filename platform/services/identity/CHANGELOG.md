# @augur/identity

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 5ab5009: Departments and teams are now two different levels. Teams right below the org are Departments, and those inside them are Teams. An admin can rename the levels, up to five, in Admin → Departments → Level names. The new `GET`/`PUT /v1/admin/levels` endpoints are audited as `levels.renamed` (identity contract 1.12.0), and a level deeper than the last name takes that name.

  Each floor's `level` reaches the shell and apps: identity's floors, and `WorkspaceRef.level` in SDK 1.9. Apps can say it where they'd say "team", and `kind` stays `team` at every level, so no app breaks.

  The shell names the level on the title card, the gauge, Account and the top left. A department also has its own icon and water colours, from the new tokens `floor-department-low` (violet) and `floor-department-high` (lavender, also its gauge mark). The kit adds `floorTone()`, `floorKindOf()`, `floorIconOf()` and `teamDepth()`, and `ShellFloorRef.level`.

### Patch Changes

- ea41136: Services stay up through a Postgres restart: a dropped idle connection is logged (`steadyPool` in the service kit) rather than ending the process, and the events service listens again on a new connection, so open notification streams don't go quiet for good.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 8f69cb5: Moving between floors travels: what you're looking at leaves the way you're going (going up, it sinks away; going down, it rises away; across, it slides aside), the host waits for that before taking the app down, and the next floor comes in from the other side. Each arrival plays an area title card in place of the floor-name pill: the kind of floor, its name set large, and who sees what's there. Opening an app plays its card too, the app's name under the floor it opened on, once per app rather than on every page. Cards are built from the floor or app, never written by hand, leave off a kicker that would only repeat the name, ignore the pointer, end on any key, press or scroll, and fade out where they are. A new Area titles switch in Settings turns them off, saved with a person's preferences (`areaTitles` in Identity). `ui-shell` gains `leaveFloor()`; new tokens `travel-floor` (96px) and `motion-title` (2400ms); kit exports `floorKindName` and `FloorDirection`. Under reduced motion nothing travels and cards appear and fade in place.
- 5bb4315: `GET /v1/me/map`: your map of the org for Auspex. It lists the floors you can stand on with who's there and why you can come in, lets leads see into the teams inside theirs, and shows every other team as a closed door that names only itself, where it sits and its leads.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- d318840: Adds the Deployment Admin role (`deployment-admin`). Identity gives it to `PLATFORM_ADMIN_USER` when nobody has it, only a deployment admin can give it, take it away or change a holder's sign-in, and holders sign in with a one-time code as well as their password (identity sets this up in Keycloak's sign-in flow at start).
- 0a7f2dd: Identity manages the platform realm as its own Keycloak client, which can manage that realm alone, and uses Keycloak's master admin only at start to give it those rights. The realm now slows down repeated wrong passwords (brute-force protection), set in the realm import and turned on at start for existing servers.

### Patch Changes

- aa1724a: Services check their settings before they start. The service kit's `loadConfig` takes a list of the settings a service reads (`Setting`, plus `commonSettings` for the ones services share). In production, a missing required setting stops the service with one message listing every problem, instead of falling back to a `localhost` address. A secret can be given as a file in `<NAME>_FILE`. `describeConfig` reports each setting and where it came from, never a secret's value, ready for Admin → Deployment.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 476907a: Apps' secrets can be worked out instead of written into `.env`. With `APP_SECRETS_KEY` set, the storage container works out each app's database password and bucket secret from it and the app's id (`appSecretFor` in the service kit) when `.env` doesn't name them, and the app runner can set an app's sign-in to the secret it works out (`PUT /v1/admin/apps/{id}/credential`, the updater only). Secrets in `.env` still win.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 4608af1: Apps can look people up for sharing, with the new `people:read` scope. Identity says who a person stands for (`GET /v1/people/:id/principals`: `person:`, `team:` and `tree:` principals and `org`) and finds people and teams by name or names them by id (`GET /v1/directory`). The service kit's `identityPrincipals` (kept 30 seconds) and `identityDirectory` call them. Admin shows the scope as "Look up people and teams".
- 936bb00: A publisher role, for people who may publish beyond their own team (to the whole org, or any team). Identity adds it to the sign-in service when it starts, so existing servers get it too. Identity says who an audience reaches (`GET /v1/members?principals=`, `people:read`), which the service kit's `identityAudience` calls, and the directory's teams carry their `path` of team ids.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- b90f63b: Signed caller: the gateway signs the person it passes on (`x-augur-caller`, Ed25519, one minute, one service as audience) and publishes its key at `/api/gateway/v1/caller-keys`. The service kit's `signedCallers` hook drops unsigned `x-user-*` headers and puts back only the signed caller; the platform's services and new apps use it.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 8c0a9c8: Servers run released images instead of building them. Each AUGUR release now builds, pushes and signs (cosign, keyless) the web, gateway, identity, registry, events and models images to `ghcr.io/<repo>/<part>:<version>`, and its `augur-release.json` asset names each by digest. `infra/deploy/compose.yml` runs `${PLATFORM_IMAGES}/<part>:${PLATFORM_VERSION}` (new setting `PLATFORM_VERSION`, optional `PLATFORM_IMAGES` for a mirror); `compose.build.yml` builds from the checkout instead. The images run as unprivileged users, and the web container listens on 8080. See "Images from releases" in `docs/upgrade.md`.
- 1622cd9: The platform is now called AUGUR. Packages move from `@platform/*` to `@augur/*`, and the shell's title, `<ui-shell>`'s default product name, Admin and new sign-in realms say AUGUR. Running servers keep their realm, database, Compose project and `.env` names; see docs/upgrade.md. The shell's import map still answers to `@platform/ui-kit`, so apps built before the rename keep loading.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- b92585d: Admin app for people, departments and apps, so nobody needs Keycloak's console. Identity gains an admin API (`/v1/admin/people`, `/departments`, `/roles`) that manages people, roles and departments in Keycloak and audits every change; an admin can't turn off their own sign-in or remove their own admin role. The registry lists the whole catalogue for admins (`GET /v1/apps`) and lets them turn an app off and on (`PATCH /v1/apps/:id`); an app that is off stays off when it registers again. Admin now appears for admins. The UI kit adds `ui-select`, `ui-toggle` and `ui-checkbox-group`, four icons (`user-plus`, `department`, `key`, `plus`), and dialogs scroll inside instead of running off the screen.
- 2abdd1d: Apps sign in to the platform as themselves. An admin issues an app's own sign-in with `POST /v1/admin/apps/{id}/credential` on identity, which makes (or gives a new secret to) the Keycloak client `app-<id>`: client credentials only, 5-minute tokens for the `platform-services` audience, audited without the secret. The app's service gets it as `SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET`; the service kit's `appCredentialsFromEnv`, `clientCredentials` and `serviceVerifier` sign in and check those tokens, and `notify`, `recordAudit` and `callService` can name the floor a call is for. Manifests gain `scopes` (`notifications:send`, `audit:write`). The registry lets an app register only itself, and tells platform services what an app is granted (`GET /v1/apps/{id}/grants?workspace=`): for now, what its manifest asks for on every floor, and nothing while it is off. Events lets an app notify and write the audit log only for itself and only with the scope on the call's floor (403 otherwise, 503 while it can't be checked), keeping each answer for 30 seconds. The shared `SERVICE_TOKEN` still works for now. The Library and new apps from `pnpm create-app` sign in as themselves when they have a secret.
- d14956f: An app can be on for one floor and off for another. The registry keeps three separate things: whether an app is turned on at all (as before), installs per floor in a new `registry.installs` table (on or off, carrying on to the teams below unless told not to), and guardrails in `registry.guardrails`, where a block on a floor wins over anything below it. Everyone's own floor follows the org. Manifests gain `floors` (the kinds of floor an app works on) and a checked `surfaces` block (page, card, panel, settings or admin per kind of floor, with an optional role and roll-up). `GET /v1/manifest?workspace=` lists the apps on for the floor the gateway checked, and grants now hold only where an app is on. Admins set floors with `PUT /v1/apps/{id}/floors/{workspace}` and see them with `GET /v1/apps/{id}/floors`; a new version asking for more scopes is served but gets them only after `PUT /v1/apps/{id}/scopes`. Identity tells platform services where a floor sits (`GET /v1/workspaces/{id}`, read with the service kit's `floorPlaces`) and offers the roll-up `GET /v1/me/workspaces/{id}/rollup`. The shell asks for the catalogue of the floor you're on and asks again when you move. Admin, Apps shows where each app is on, floor by floor, with a choice for each, and lets an admin allow scopes a new version asks for. Services need `IDENTITY_URL` (set in both compose files).
- d1f8c5e: Notifications and the audit log know their floor. A service call that names a floor records it on each notification and audit entry, with the floor's path from the root as it stood then (asked of identity), so "everything under Finance" stays right after a team moves. `GET /v1/audit?workspace=` filters to a floor and the floors below it; admins read the whole log and a lead their own floor's. Team notices are opt-in per team (`PUT /v1/team-notices/{workspace}`, by its leads or an admin): `notify` with `toTeam` reaches everyone on the team as it is when sent, asked of identity's new `GET /v1/workspaces/{id}/people`. Identity records department changes on the department's floor, and the registry records floor rules on theirs. The shell tags a notification from another floor with its name, puts a dot on the gauge (and a count in Account) where something waits, and opening one goes to its floor. Admin, Activity filters by floor and says which floor an app was turned on, off or blocked for.
- fd53bd1: Identity keeps the floors people stand on: one org, teams that nest up to five deep, and everyone's own floor, in its own tables (`identity.workspaces`, `identity.workspace_members`, on Postgres `ltree`). `GET /v1/me/workspaces` answers the caller's floors with each one's path from the org, their role and whether they're on it directly or through a team below; their own floor is made the first time they ask. Admin's departments are now these teams: the first start copies Keycloak's groups and their members in once, and from then on the Departments screen and each person's departments change identity's tables, not Keycloak. `ORG_NAME` names the org's floor (default "Organisation").
- 94ea6cc: Notifications can carry actions, and the stream is grouped by app (SDK 1.2). `ctx.notify({ …, actions })` and the service kit's `notify` take up to two `{ label, intent }` buttons; pressing one in the stream raises its intent through the shell exactly as `ctx.raise` does (on the notification's own floor when it's from another) and marks it read, so no app code runs in the stream. The events service checks and keeps them (`actions` on `POST /v1/notifications`, a payload of at most 1 KB, migration `003_actions`), and sends a notification too big for Postgres's 8000-byte notify by id. The stream groups by app, apps with something that needs you first; each group's ⋯ mutes the app, which keeps its notifications in the stream silently (no pulse, not counted in the band) and saves `muted` in preferences, which identity now accepts. The contract tests check that an action raises its intent, skipping it for builds from before SDK 1.2. The kit gains `ui-menu` (a short list of actions from a button, with keys, danger last) and the `more` and `mute` icons.
- 0295651: The shared `SERVICE_TOKEN` is gone: every app and platform service signs in as itself. The service kit drops `SERVICE_TOKEN_HEADER`, `serviceFromHeaders` and `withoutServiceHeaders`; `ServiceCredentials` is now a name and a token source, and `platformCredentialsFromEnv` signs a platform service in as `platform-<name>`. Identity makes each platform service's Keycloak client (and the Library's, locally) from `SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRETS` when it starts, retrying until Keycloak is up. The registry and events accept only signed-in services; events asks the registry for grants as `platform-events`. `pnpm register-app` signs in as the app. Admin, Apps shows what each app may do and issues a new sign-in, showing its secret once. The deploy needs `IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET`, `REGISTRY_CLIENT_SECRET` and `EVENTS_CLIENT_SECRET` in place of `SERVICE_TOKEN` (see docs/upgrade.md).
- 778157a: Shell alpha: settings, Away and recent apps save to each person's account through a new Identity preferences API (`/v1/me/preferences`); Find also searches every app's menu pages and opens them; Agents, Switch workspace and the unbuilt Admin app are hidden until they exist. The UI kit adds `reducedMotion()`, which honours `data-motion="reduce"` on `<html>`, and `canSwitchWorkspace` on `ui-shell`.

### Patch Changes

- 4c96907: Backups are proven, not only taken. Once a week (and on first start) the backup container restores the newest backup into a throwaway database, checks the platform's tables and Keycloak's people came back, and records the result; `backup.sh --restore-test` runs one now. The gateway reads the last backup and restore test from `BACKUP_DIR` and adds them to `GET /api/gateway/v1/status` (API 1.1.0); Admin's Status shows them and its heading says "Backups need a look" when one failed or is overdue. Every request now carries one id from nginx through the gateway to each service: service-kit's `serviceLogging()` labels every log line with `requestId`, and the gateway returns it in `x-request-id`. New guide: `docs/upgrade.md`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- b705f16: Version the HTTP APIs and report releases on health. Each service's API now lives under `/v1` (through the gateway, `/api/<service>/v1/...`), matching its OpenAPI contract's major version, and `GET /healthz` answers with the service's release and API version. The registry requires every app to say which SDK releases it works with (`sdk`, a semver range) and a semver `version`; the shell won't open an app whose range its SDK doesn't satisfy, and says why.
