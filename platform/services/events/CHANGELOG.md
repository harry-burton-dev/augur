# @augur/events

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- a09b413: Domain events: services tell each other what happened. The events service keeps events on topics (`folio.document.published`), which an app publishes on its own topics with the new `events:publish` scope, and hands them out in one order, never with a gap, to services with `events:subscribe`. It publishes the platform's own (`platform.person.disabled`, `platform.team.member-added`, `platform.app.turned-off` and more) as identity and the registry record those changes. The service kit adds an outbox (`OUTBOX_TABLE_SQL`, `addToOutbox`, `outboxRelay`) so an event is sent if and only if its change commits, `followEvents` for followers, `publishEvents` and `PLATFORM_TOPICS`. Admin names the two new scopes. Events are kept 30 days. See docs/domain-events.md.
- b90f63b: Signed caller: the gateway signs the person it passes on (`x-augur-caller`, Ed25519, one minute, one service as audience) and publishes its key at `/api/gateway/v1/caller-keys`. The service kit's `signedCallers` hook drops unsigned `x-user-*` headers and puts back only the signed caller; the platform's services and new apps use it.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 8c0a9c8: Servers run released images instead of building them. Each AUGUR release now builds, pushes and signs (cosign, keyless) the web, gateway, identity, registry, events and models images to `ghcr.io/<repo>/<part>:<version>`, and its `augur-release.json` asset names each by digest. `infra/deploy/compose.yml` runs `${PLATFORM_IMAGES}/<part>:${PLATFORM_VERSION}` (new setting `PLATFORM_VERSION`, optional `PLATFORM_IMAGES` for a mirror); `compose.build.yml` builds from the checkout instead. The images run as unprivileged users, and the web container listens on 8080. See "Images from releases" in `docs/upgrade.md`.
- 1622cd9: The platform is now called AUGUR. Packages move from `@platform/*` to `@augur/*`, and the shell's title, `<ui-shell>`'s default product name, Admin and new sign-in realms say AUGUR. Running servers keep their realm, database, Compose project and `.env` names; see docs/upgrade.md. The shell's import map still answers to `@platform/ui-kit`, so apps built before the rename keep loading.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- c40b827: Activity in Admin: the audit log, readable. Events' `GET /v1/audit` gains `since` and `until` (a time range) and `before` (the id of the oldest entry shown, for the next page); API 1.1.0. Admin's new Activity screen, under Platform, lists every change newest first as a sentence ("Alex Rivera added Sam Okafor to Finance"), filters by who, where and when (today, 7 days, 30 days, any time, or between two dates), shows 50 at a time with Show older, and opens any change to see everything recorded about it.
- 2abdd1d: Apps sign in to the platform as themselves. An admin issues an app's own sign-in with `POST /v1/admin/apps/{id}/credential` on identity, which makes (or gives a new secret to) the Keycloak client `app-<id>`: client credentials only, 5-minute tokens for the `platform-services` audience, audited without the secret. The app's service gets it as `SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET`; the service kit's `appCredentialsFromEnv`, `clientCredentials` and `serviceVerifier` sign in and check those tokens, and `notify`, `recordAudit` and `callService` can name the floor a call is for. Manifests gain `scopes` (`notifications:send`, `audit:write`). The registry lets an app register only itself, and tells platform services what an app is granted (`GET /v1/apps/{id}/grants?workspace=`): for now, what its manifest asks for on every floor, and nothing while it is off. Events lets an app notify and write the audit log only for itself and only with the scope on the call's floor (403 otherwise, 503 while it can't be checked), keeping each answer for 30 seconds. The shared `SERVICE_TOKEN` still works for now. The Library and new apps from `pnpm create-app` sign in as themselves when they have a secret.
- d1f8c5e: Notifications and the audit log know their floor. A service call that names a floor records it on each notification and audit entry, with the floor's path from the root as it stood then (asked of identity), so "everything under Finance" stays right after a team moves. `GET /v1/audit?workspace=` filters to a floor and the floors below it; admins read the whole log and a lead their own floor's. Team notices are opt-in per team (`PUT /v1/team-notices/{workspace}`, by its leads or an admin): `notify` with `toTeam` reaches everyone on the team as it is when sent, asked of identity's new `GET /v1/workspaces/{id}/people`. Identity records department changes on the department's floor, and the registry records floor rules on theirs. The shell tags a notification from another floor with its name, puts a dot on the gauge (and a count in Account) where something waits, and opening one goes to its floor. Admin, Activity filters by floor and says which floor an app was turned on, off or blocked for.
- 94ea6cc: Notifications can carry actions, and the stream is grouped by app (SDK 1.2). `ctx.notify({ …, actions })` and the service kit's `notify` take up to two `{ label, intent }` buttons; pressing one in the stream raises its intent through the shell exactly as `ctx.raise` does (on the notification's own floor when it's from another) and marks it read, so no app code runs in the stream. The events service checks and keeps them (`actions` on `POST /v1/notifications`, a payload of at most 1 KB, migration `003_actions`), and sends a notification too big for Postgres's 8000-byte notify by id. The stream groups by app, apps with something that needs you first; each group's ⋯ mutes the app, which keeps its notifications in the stream silently (no pulse, not counted in the band) and saves `muted` in preferences, which identity now accepts. The contract tests check that an action raises its intent, skipping it for builds from before SDK 1.2. The kit gains `ui-menu` (a short list of actions from a button, with keys, danger last) and the `more` and `mute` icons.
- 0295651: The shared `SERVICE_TOKEN` is gone: every app and platform service signs in as itself. The service kit drops `SERVICE_TOKEN_HEADER`, `serviceFromHeaders` and `withoutServiceHeaders`; `ServiceCredentials` is now a name and a token source, and `platformCredentialsFromEnv` signs a platform service in as `platform-<name>`. Identity makes each platform service's Keycloak client (and the Library's, locally) from `SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRETS` when it starts, retrying until Keycloak is up. The registry and events accept only signed-in services; events asks the registry for grants as `platform-events`. `pnpm register-app` signs in as the app. Admin, Apps shows what each app may do and issues a new sign-in, showing its secret once. The deploy needs `IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET`, `REGISTRY_CLIENT_SECRET` and `EVENTS_CLIENT_SECRET` in place of `SERVICE_TOKEN` (see docs/upgrade.md).

### Patch Changes

- 6a64067: Security fixes from the code review. The gateway checks sign-in on every path but `/healthz`, by the route a request matched rather than its raw URL, so a percent-encoded path such as `/%61pi/library/…` can no longer skip the check. It no longer forwards the person's `Authorization` header to any service; services already get the caller in `x-user-*` headers. `APP_UPSTREAMS` may not name a platform service. The registry refuses an app route inside or around another app's route (`/admin/people` would have taken over Admin's People page). Events treats an `X-Workspace-Id` that won't URI-decode as an unknown floor (400) instead of failing with 500.
- 4c96907: Backups are proven, not only taken. Once a week (and on first start) the backup container restores the newest backup into a throwaway database, checks the platform's tables and Keycloak's people came back, and records the result; `backup.sh --restore-test` runs one now. The gateway reads the last backup and restore test from `BACKUP_DIR` and adds them to `GET /api/gateway/v1/status` (API 1.1.0); Admin's Status shows them and its heading says "Backups need a look" when one failed or is overdue. Every request now carries one id from nginx through the gateway to each service: service-kit's `serviceLogging()` labels every log line with `requestId`, and the gateway returns it in `x-request-id`. New guide: `docs/upgrade.md`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- b705f16: Version the HTTP APIs and report releases on health. Each service's API now lives under `/v1` (through the gateway, `/api/<service>/v1/...`), matching its OpenAPI contract's major version, and `GET /healthz` answers with the service's release and API version. The registry requires every app to say which SDK releases it works with (`sdk`, a semver range) and a semver `version`; the shell won't open an app whose range its SDK doesn't satisfy, and says why.
