One read key per deployment. With a read:packages token in `secrets/github-read-key` and `GITHUB_READ_USER` in `.env`, the registry checks for new AUGUR and app releases in the feed the Release workflow now keeps beside the images (`ghcr.io/<repo>/feed:latest`, `RELEASE_FEED_URL=oci://…`), and the updater signs Docker in with the same key to pull. The older `release-feed-token` and `image-pull-token` still work. See "The read key" in docs/upgrade.md.
