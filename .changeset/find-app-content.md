Find searches apps' own content (SDK 1.3). An app that declares `"search": true` in its manifest (the registry now accepts it) answers `GET /v1/search?q=` on its service with `{ results: [{ id, title, detail?, path?, workspace? }] }` (`SearchAnswer` and `SearchResult` in the SDK). As the person types, after a short pause and from two letters, the shell asks every such app on the current floor at once, through the gateway with the floor attached. Each app's results (at most ten, the current floor's first, others tagged with their floor) show under its name after Apps and Pages as they arrive. One still answering says "Still looking…" and one that takes longer than 1.5 seconds is let go, so none holds up the rest. Choosing a result opens its app at its `path`, on its floor. `ui-shell` takes `findGroups` beside `findResults` for results grouped and still coming. The contract tests check that Find asks the reference app on the floor and opens what it answers, and that a slow app doesn't hold Find up.
