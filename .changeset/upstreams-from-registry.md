The gateway finds apps' services through the registry. Whatever runs an app (a platform service) or an admin says where its service is (`PUT /v1/apps/{id}/upstream`), and the gateway sends `/api/<id>/…` there, asking the registry as itself (`GET /v1/upstreams`, the signed caller `augur:gateway`) every 30 seconds and keeping the last answer through a registry restart. Status checks those apps too. `APP_UPSTREAMS` still works and wins for the apps it names, so nothing changes for a server until an app is set up this way. Upstreams can never be one of the platform's own parts.
