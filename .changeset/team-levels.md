Departments and teams are now two different levels. Teams right below the org are Departments, and those inside them are Teams. An admin can rename the levels, up to five, in Admin → Departments → Level names. The new `GET`/`PUT /v1/admin/levels` endpoints are audited as `levels.renamed` (identity contract 1.12.0), and a level deeper than the last name takes that name.

Each floor's `level` reaches the shell and apps: identity's floors, and `WorkspaceRef.level` in SDK 1.9. Apps can say it where they'd say "team", and `kind` stays `team` at every level, so no app breaks.

The shell names the level on the title card, the gauge, Account and the top left. A department also has its own icon and water colours, from the new tokens `floor-department-low` (violet) and `floor-department-high` (lavender, also its gauge mark). The kit adds `floorTone()`, `floorKindOf()`, `floorIconOf()` and `teamDepth()`, and `ShellFloorRef.level`.
