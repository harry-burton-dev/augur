Admin app for people, departments and apps, so nobody needs Keycloak's console. Identity gains an admin API (`/v1/admin/people`, `/departments`, `/roles`) that manages people, roles and departments in Keycloak and audits every change; an admin can't turn off their own sign-in or remove their own admin role. The registry lists the whole catalogue for admins (`GET /v1/apps`) and lets them turn an app off and on (`PATCH /v1/apps/:id`); an app that is off stays off when it registers again. Admin now appears for admins. The UI kit adds `ui-select`, `ui-toggle` and `ui-checkbox-group`, four icons (`user-plus`, `department`, `key`, `plus`), and dialogs scroll inside instead of running off the screen.
