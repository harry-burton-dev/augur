Go back: Admin → Updates lists the releases before yours and goes back to one with the updater's usual steps (a backup first), while no release between is breaking; across a breaking one it says which and why, and going back is by hand. The updater stops parts the older release doesn't have, and starts them again if it has to roll back. Admin → Apps goes back to one of an app's three earlier versions and holds it there. Registry contract 1.25.0 (`PUT /v1/platform/go-back`, `goBack`, `older`).
